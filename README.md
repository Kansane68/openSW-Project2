23-2 openSW Term2 project code

1. using pandas and numpy to print data
1-1. Print the top 10 players in hits (안타, H), batting average (타율, avg), homerun (홈런, HR), and on- 
base percentage (출루율, OBP) for each year from 2015 to 2018.
1-2. Print the player with the highest war (승리  기여도) by position (cp) in 2018.
1-3. Among R (득점), H (안타), HR (홈런), RBI (타점), SB (도루), war (승리  기여도), avg (타율), OBP 
(출루율), and SLG (장타율), which has the highest correlation with salary (연봉)?

2. Train various ML models to predict the salary of the batter in the specific year (using three kinds of ML models)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine Regressor
- (only use numerical features)
